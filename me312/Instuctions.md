This script is to do all the analysis for the project
(1) adding only a reheater to achieve 600 K
(2) adding only closed feed-­‐water heater (CFWH)
(3) adding only an open feed-­‐water heater (OFWH)
(Maximum grad of A)  
For each of the three options listed above, 
examine and plot the   

influence of changing the intermediate pressure on 
    (a) the thermal cycle efficiency,   
    (b) the exergetic efficiency of the cycle,    
    (c) the second law efficiencies of each component,
          Omit(superheater, reheater, condenser)
    (d) the exergy balance terms of each component.
          Omit (superheater, reheater, condenser) 
Use at least 10 intermediate pressures. 
Pick the option and intermediate pressure that you recommend to your boss. 
Use isentropic pump efficiencies of 0.95 
  and isentropic turbine efficiencies of 0.90
Dead state conditions: T=300K, P=100kPa
