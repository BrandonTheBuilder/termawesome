*Thermawsome*
This is a thermodynamic analysis software that uses coolprop to evaluate fluids at specific states and uses thermodynamic energy balances to evaluate the system of state change processes. 
For now I am assuming steady state, steady flow for all systems. That might change. 
Neglect Potential and Kinetic Energies
All units used for backend analysis will be SI. 
    * mass, kg
    * energy, J
    * pressure, Pa
    * time, s
    * temperatur, K
